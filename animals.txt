seals are my favorite animal, seadogs 
Why?
they are so darn cute
they are oblong and their namefor walking is "galumping"
they are basically the mermaid equivalent of a dog or wolf, but are even more friendly shaped

a close second would be land dogs
	because of my puppies i adore, rosie and lucy. 
and one more would be giraffes 
	which i collect figurines of <3

but i like most every animal, those are just the ones i have a soft spot for.
