	Git is a application on the computer's hardrive that allows you to directly interact with your repositories, which are saved in the cloud and can be viewed and accessed online via your GitHub account. Others can view your projects  


Describe what each of the following commands do in your own words:


Git Clone
Copies a repository from the cloud (GitHub) onto your computer so you can work on the file locally before you return it fixed or updated

Git Status
Checks the status of every file in the project folder to see if the data has been modified since a save hs occurred. if so, the modified file is untracked and marked red. Then you proceed with the following three commands.

Git Add
Checks the most recent data from the file in question you want to save, selects it for next steps

Git Commit -m ""
Labels the file with what is relavent about the current save, basically tags it

Git Push
uploads the committed file to the repository in the cloud so it can be the new master others will work from.
