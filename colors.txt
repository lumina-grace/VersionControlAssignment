Colors wise, im very opinionated.
When given the option, i do tend towards pastles.
specifically Pricilla Pink, Lilac purple, or Icy blue
My favorite pallet to work with in my physical art is undoubtley CMY or the tints of.
All other colors have such strong semantic associations in my head that if i use them while working it it usually to label or remind me of what im remembering it for. i don't understand others who are able to write or even type their notes or thoughts in all the same color with no emphasis. i guess it comes to mind since with these text files thats all they are.

sorry this is a few days late. but as im writing this i do not have a migraine! which is a WIN. when i sat down to do this on Friday it seemed as if it made my brain pulse with confusion (it was already pulsing, to be fair)
